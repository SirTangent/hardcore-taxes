# Hardcore Taxes
Because you decided that using tax filing software was too easy.

---

## Description
This is a Kotlin application that "hopefully" allows an individual to file their taxes in the United States. My idea for an MVP is to have W-2 and 1099 support. The output is your form 1040 you send to the IRS. I think I like taxes too much.

## Why.. Like, seriously?!
Well I always used TurboTax, like everyone else, to file every year. Then I got an SE job and did some stock trading for a short period of time. Why is that related? Well TurboTax said, you do trading, therefore we charge you for premium filing. So instead of making my life easier by paying for easy tax filing, I decide to do everything by hand, or at least code it by hand, and here we are!
